      <title>Description</title>
      <para>
        &gtkrsync; is a graphical interface for displaying the progress of
        an &rsync;(1) session.  It displays a running status display from
        parsing the output of <literal>rsync --progress -v</literal>.  This
        status display includes a per-file and overall status bar, overall
        estimated time to completion, and an expandable button that shows
        all rsync status output.
      </para> 

      <para> Unlike other GUI rsync frontends such as grsync, &gtkrsync; does
        not have any GUI tools for configuring or invoking rsync.  &gtkrsync;
        is designed to be invoked from the command line or shell scripts,
        which already specify all the needed rsync options.  It is thus ideal
        for scripted &rsync; runs that need a GUI, or for command-line users
        that would like a GUI to monitor their &rsync; progress.
      </para>

      <para>
        &gtkrsync; is a drop-in replacement
 for rsync.  It fires up the GUI and invokes &rsync;, passing all args to
 it.  When invoked this way, &gtkrsync; is able to detect if &rsync; exits
 in error and alerts the user.  &gtkrsync; can also monitor both stdout
 and stderr from &rsync;, and displays both.  The cancel button in
 &gtkrsync; also will kill off the &rsync; process.  You must make sure to
 pass <literal>--progress -v</literal> on the &gtkrsync; command line in
 order to get enough information out of &rsync; to build a proper GUI.
      </para>

      <para>
        The other binary is &gtkrsyncp;.  This program accepts the output of
        <literal>rsync --progress -v</literal> on standard input and displays it in a GUI.  It
 cannot detect whether &rsync; exited in error and cannot kill &rsync; when
 Cancel is pressed.  However, this program may be useful in some cases
 when direct control of &rsync; is handled elsewhere.

    <refsect1 id="hg.man.hg.buildpackage.options">
      <title>Options</title>
      <para>
        All options passed to &gtkrsync; are sent directly to
        <application>rsync</application>(1).  &gtkrsyncp; takes no options.
      </para>

    <refsect1 id="hg.man.hg.buildpackage.environment">
      <title>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</title>
      <para>
        &gtkrsync; will look for an <literal>RSYNC</literal> environment
        variable.  If set, it is taken to be the name of the &rsync; binary.
        If not given, <literal>rsync</literal> is used.  &gtkrsyncp; does not
        use this variable.
      </para>
      <para>
        This application uses no other environment variables directly, but other
        programs or standard libraries may do so.  <literal>DISPLAY</literal>,
        for instance, must be set for the X libraries to work.
      </para>
      <para>
        Users using &rsync; over <application>ssh</application> may find the
        <literal>SSH_ASKPASS</literal> variable useful.  This is interpreted
        directly by <application>ssh</application> and can specify a GUI tool
        to use to prompt the user for a password when needed.
      </para>
