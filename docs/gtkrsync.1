.SH NAME
gtkrsync \- GUI front-end for rsync
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgtkrsync\fR [ \fB\fIargs for rsync\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ]


\fBgtkrsyncp\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgtkrsync\fR is a graphical interface for displaying the progress of
an \fBrsync\fR(1) session.  It displays a running status display from
parsing the output of rsync --progress -v
(with --no-inc-recursive with \fBrsync\fR v3.0 or
above).  This
status display includes a per-file and overall status bar, overall
estimated time to completion, and an expandable button that shows
all rsync status output.
.PP
Unlike other GUI rsync frontends such as grsync, \fBgtkrsync\fR does
not have any GUI tools for configuring or invoking rsync.  \fBgtkrsync\fR
is designed to be invoked from the command line or shell scripts,
which already specify all the needed rsync options.  It is thus ideal
for scripted \fBrsync\fR runs that need a GUI, or for command-line users
that would like a GUI to monitor their \fBrsync\fR progress.
.PP
\fBgtkrsync\fR is a drop-in replacement
for rsync.  It fires up the GUI and invokes \fBrsync\fR, passing all args to
it.  When invoked this way, \fBgtkrsync\fR is able to detect if \fBrsync\fR exits
in error and alerts the user.  \fBgtkrsync\fR can also monitor both stdout
and stderr from \fBrsync\fR, and displays both.  The cancel button in
\fBgtkrsync\fR also will kill off the \fBrsync\fR process.  You must make sure to
pass --progress -v on the \fBgtkrsync\fR command line in
order to get enough information out of \fBrsync\fR to build a proper GUI.
.PP
If ysing \fBrsync\fR version 3.0 or above, you must also add
--no-inc-recursive to your command line.
These newer versions of \fBrsync\fR use incremental tree scanning
by default.  As a result, they do not emit information up
front about the expected number of files to transfer, and thus
\fBgtkrsync\fR would lack enough information to display its
progress bars.
.PP
Besides \fBgtkrsync\fR, the other binary is \fBgtkrsyncp\fR\&.  This program accepts the output of
rsync --progress -v on standard input and displays it in a GUI.  It
cannot detect whether \fBrsync\fR exited in error and cannot kill \fBrsync\fR when
Cancel is pressed.  However, this program may be useful in some cases
when direct control of \fBrsync\fR is handled elsewhere.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
All options passed to \fBgtkrsync\fR are sent directly to
\fBrsync\fR(1).  \fBgtkrsyncp\fR takes no options.
.SH "EXIT VALUES"
.PP
\fBgtkrsync\fR and \fBgtkrsyncp\fR both return 0 on success or 20 if the user
clicked Cancel or closed the window before the \fBrsync\fR was complete.
20 is also the code that \fBrsync\fR uses to indicate a transfer
interrupted by the user.
.PP
In all other cases, \fBgtkrsync\fR returns the result code that \fBrsync\fR
returned.  \fBgtkrsyncp\fR returns 0.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
\fBgtkrsync\fR will look for an RSYNC environment
variable.  If set, it is taken to be the name of the \fBrsync\fR binary.
If not given, rsync is used.  \fBgtkrsyncp\fR does not
use this variable.
.PP
This application uses no other environment variables directly, but other
programs or standard libraries may do so.  DISPLAY,
for instance, must be set for the X libraries to work.
.PP
Users using \fBrsync\fR over \fBssh\fR may find the
SSH_ASKPASS variable useful.  This is interpreted
directly by \fBssh\fR and can specify a GUI tool
to use to prompt the user for a password when needed.
